CraftMasters Art Supplies is a mid-sized retail business
located in Mumbai, specializing in selling high-quality art
supplies such as paints, brushes, canvases, and crafting
materials. They serve a diverse clientele, includingprofessional artists, hobbyists, and art schools. The store
employs 5 sales associates who assist customers in finding the
right products and manage the day-to-day operations of the
store.
Currently, CraftMasters Art Supplies captures all their sales
transactions, inventory levels, and customer details using a
paper-based system. This manual system has become
increasingly inefficient as the business has expanded. They
are facing challenges in managing inventory, tracking
customer preferences, and processing sales, which often leads
to delays, errors, and lost sales opportunities.
Recognizing these issues, CraftMasters Art Supplies has
decided to digitize their entire operation. They aim to
implement a modern, integrated digital solution that will
allow them to streamline inventory management, enhance
customer relationship management (CRM), and optimize sales
processes.
You have been hired as an external consultant to help
CraftMasters Art Supplies transition from their paper-based
system to a digital platform. Your responsibilities include
analyzing their current operations, designing a tailored digital
solution, and overseeing the implementation process to ensure
a seamless transition that supports their growing business
needs.
Task
Produce a relational database design that captures the current
data stored and provide a report (write up) that includes:
• Rationale of design choices.
• The extensibility of your design.
• Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) that reflects your
design. This should include attributes and relationships
(cardinality).
